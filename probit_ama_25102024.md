# ProBit AMA (25/10/2024)

## Part 1
***Je ne vous fais pas l'affront de vous présenter Sébastien Dupont et Nilesh Patankar (Archethic). Ils sont accompagnés de Surbhi (ProBit) pour cette AMA texte sur Telegram. Démarrage de l'AMA le 25/10/2024 à 9:00 (Paris)***

Quelques échanges avant la partie 2 :

Surbhi :
>Please provide our audience with a brief overview of the project, What problems does Archethic (UCO) aim to solve?
And perhaps, to add to that, its core vision?

Sébastien:
>At Archethic, we’ve created the world’s first cold wallet without seed phrases. Traditional cold wallets rely on these long seed phrases, and if they’re lost, stolen, or hacked, your funds are gone. We’ve removed that risk entirely. Instead of seed phrases, we use biometric authentication - your fingerprint generates the private key on the fly and it is automatically deleted, nothing is stored and hence nothing to hack or steal. It’s fully GDPR compliant, so your biometric data is never at risk
If you lose your device, no worries. Just pick up any compatible device, use your fingerprint, and you can instantly access your funds. No recovery process, no risk - it’s that simple and secure.

Nilesh:
>Our vision goes beyond crypto. We aim to secure all digital assets using biometrics. Imagine a world where passwords don’t exist, and everything - whether online or offline - is protected by your biometric identity. With total privacy and security, powered by the Archethic blockchain, we’re building a password-free future.

Surbhi:
>What is the utility of the Archethic (UCO) tokens?

Nilesh:
>Sure, Great question! To make our cold wallet work the way we envisioned, we had to develop our own blockchain, and this blockchain is powered by the UCO token. UCO has two main functions. First, it’s used to pay transaction fees on the blockchain. Second, it plays a key role in governance, allowing holders to participate in decision-making for the project’s future.

Sébastien:
>The key feature of our token UCO is the link between UCO and our cold wallet. For every wallet sold, $30 worth of UCO is bought from the market and burned. This creates direct demand for the token and reduces its overall supply. To put it in perspective, when we reach 1,000,000 wallets sold, that’s $30 million worth of UCO bought and burned.
So, as our cold wallet grows, it creates ongoing demand and scarcity for UCO, driving long-term value.

Surbhi:
>Now I am eager to know about the the Archethic plan and the tokenomics

Sébastien:
>Sure! Let me first answer the tokenomics aspect of the project. As I mentioned, UCO is crucial to our ecosystem, powering transactions and governance. Plus, every cold wallet sold buys and burns $30 worth of UCO, which drives demand for the token. The on-going demand will keep creating scarcity. This crypto-economic phenomena will lead to long term value/wealth creation.

Nilesh:
>Looking ahead, the core plan for Archethic is to expand the ecosystem by attracting developers to build dApps on the Archethic blockchain. Once we hit a critical mass of users with our cold wallet, it’s going to be a massive opportunity for projects that need biometric authentication or proof of humanity. Developers will instantly gain access to a large, qualified user base - people already using our wallet - so they can deploy their tech and reach a ready-made community.
To support this, we’re also launching international marketing campaigns to grow our user base and bring Archethic into the mainstream.

Surbhi:
>What's something unique that Archethic (UCO) is doing that sets you apart?

Nilesh:
>We have many USPs, something that really sets Archethic apart is the depth of innovation behind our technology. We hold 11 patents in both blockchain and biometric technology, which gives us a unique advantage in combining these two fields. Our cold wallet isn’t just special because it eliminates seed phrases - it’s also directly linked to the UCO token.
This means every time a wallet is sold, $30 worth of UCO is bought from the market and burned. So, the community that holds UCO benefits directly from the financial success of the cold wallet. Unlike other major cold wallets, where there’s no way for users to invest or profit, Archethic’s cold wallet ties the product’s success to our token holders.

Sébastien:
>Another interesting aspect is that we’ve integrated smart contracts into the wallet’s design. This solves a big issue with traditional cold wallets - inheritance. Usually, if you don’t share your seed phrase and you pass away, your funds are lost forever. With Archethic, you can securely plan for this through smart contracts, ensuring your assets are safely transferred to beneficiaries.

Surbhi:
>what milestones have you already achieved?
And adding to it What are your major goals for this year and 2025?

Sébastien:
>The first 8 years of Archethic were focused on research and building the foundation. We developed 11 patents and created a new blockchain with a unique consensus mechanism designed for scalability and security. That foundation was essential.

Nilesh:
>From now, until the end of 2025, our focus is on completing the production phase of our cold wallet and going full throttle on marketing to introduce Archethic to the world. We want people to see how different our cold wallet is, especially with its biometric authentication and the elimination of seed phrases.
Once the cold wallet is released, we’ll shift our attention to growing the ecosystem. We’re looking to bring in developers to build on top of our blockchain, leveraging our unique biometric features. This will help expand Archethic’s use cases beyond crypto storage, opening opportunities in digital identity, secure access, and much more.

## Part 2 Q&A (préparées)

## Q1

> Q: The concept of a biometric cold wallet is relatively new. Can you explain how users can regain access to their funds if they forget their biometric identification method? What contingency measures are in place to prevent users from being locked out of their assets?

> A: Well, it’s pretty hard to forget your own biometrics unless you’ve somehow cut off all 10 fingers or, you know, passed away! But even in those cases, we’ve got you covered. With Archethic, your biometric authentication is backed by smart contracts on our blockchain.
> If you can’t use your biometrics, or if you pass away, we offer decentralized, secure recovery options. You can set up trusted contacts—family or friends—to approve access, or use time-locked recovery, which allows you to regain control after a set period.
> All of this is managed without relying on third parties, ensuring your assets stay secure while giving you full control over recovery.

## Q2

> Q: Marketing is a central element for every project so everyone knows that the potential a project can bring is vital to achieving the set goals. What is your strategy to attract new users and investors to the_ _@archethic_ _project and keep them long-term?

> A: Our strategy is built around the upcoming launch of our cold wallet, which has a clear competitive advantage—no seed phrases, no risk of lost or stolen funds.
> We plan to offer a referral commission higher than the top cold wallet competitors, focusing on partnerships with major traffic sources like comparators and influencers to drive adoption when we launch.
> In the meantime, we’ll be running public communications and community-building campaigns to grow awareness and excitement around Archethic and the UCO token. This will lay the groundwork so that when the wallet is released, we’ll have a strong and engaged community ready to adopt the technology. And by introducing new UCO holders, we’re giving users a long-term stake in the wallet’s success, ensuring sustained engagement.

## Q3

> Q: Aside being able to purchase the_ _$UCO_ _token,what other strategic ways would users be able to earn and accumulate this token?Is there plans or considerations on starting a staking program?if yes, when will it be available?

> A: Great question! While purchasing $UCO is one way to accumulate the token, users can also earn $UCO by providing liquidity on our decentralized exchange, aeSwap.
Since early August, we’ve been offering a farming pool with over 200% APR for providing UCO liquidity. This APR has remained above 200% for 3 months, making it a great opportunity for those who want to earn rewards by supporting the ecosystem.

## Q4

> Q: IMPORTANT QUESTION, on which network can I get your_ _$UCO_ _token?
> 1) BSC chain
> 2) Tron
> 3) Ethereum
> 4) Polygon
> Or any other network, can you tell us?

> A: Well, since Probit is hosting this AMA, I’ve got to start by saying you can get $UCO right here! But beyond Probit, you can also find $UCO on BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Polygon, Ethereum, and, of course, on our own Archethic chain.

## Q5

> Q: As $archethic prepares for its roadmap milestones, including the release of the biometric cold wallet, what are your primary objectives for the next 12 months? What key performance indicators will you use to measure the success of these initiatives?

> A: Our main goal over the next 12 months is to grow our community and build momentum for the release of our biometric cold wallet. We’ve already launched a waitlist (https://www.archethic.net/wallet_hw.html), and we’re excited to have over 1,000 sign-ups before even starting any marketing. Our key metric will be waitlist growth, as it shows early interest and adoption potential.

## Part 3 Quiz
Que des questions basiques (donc je ne vais pas les relayers ici). Les bots étaient présents en masse pour spam et balancer des réponses incorrectes. Les 5 gagnants des 5 questions du Quizz sont des personnes de la commu Archethic FR (au moins pas de dump des UCO gagnés même si c'est dérisoire).

## Part 4 Bonus questions
Questions libres dans le chat, environ 4000 questions posées (bots ?) en 30 secondes. 5 questions sont tirées au sort / choisies par l'équipe.
### Q1

> Q: 💎💎💎💎How will you increase the token's value, liquidity, and utility for long-term stability and investor returns?

>A: The token value is controlled through scarcity, farming and liquidity management. Plus, every cold wallet sold buys and burns $30 worth of UCO, which drives demand for the token. The on-going demand will keep creating scarcity high and the crypto-economic phenomena will lead to long term value/wealth creation. So go ahead and join the waitlist: https://www.archethic.net/wallet_hw.html

### Q2
> Q: Are you afraid some day there will be another project with more innovative technology can replace your project ?

>A: Not in the near future. What really sets Archethic apart is the depth of innovation behind our technology.
